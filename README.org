* Introduction

Tired of spending a whole day configuring your Mac/Linux? Then you've come to
the right place.

Oh-my-laptop try to provide a simple, modular and flexible way to turn your
laptop into an awesome working partner.

This project starts out as a bunch of personal scripts, days when I have to
initialize my laptop, my vagrant box, my newly-got Mac. I'm tired and I want
some robots.

Actually, Github has a similar project called [[https://boxen.github.com/][boxen]]. However, boxen only works
for Mac and it adopt [[http://puppetlabs.com/][Puppet]] and *I dislike Puppet*.

I prefer [[http://www.ansible.com/][ansible]], for its simplity. Ansible requires no agent in client. The
only thing ansible requires is ssh, which lives on almost every *nix based
machine. Second, unlike Puppet/Chef, which create a huge and complex DSL,
ansible adopt [[http://www.yaml.org/][YAML]], which makes it quite easy to learn, read and write.

Currently, oh-my-laptop has been tested on Mac OS X 10.10 and [[http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2653][Linux Mint 17
KDE]], and it should works on some Ubuntu-derived Linux distributions---which
means, I don't have too much time to test all Ubuntu(apt-get)-derived Linux
distributions.

* Features

- Modular, only install and configure necessary packages as you need.
- Literate, every package has full documentation or links to demonstrate why we
  choose it and why we configure it this way.
- Simple, all modules are written in ansible playbook, plain YAML format, quite
  easy to read, write and contribute.
- Fast, all ansible roles in oh-my-laptop are idempotent, and roles always has
  proper dependency relations, and it is guaranteed that each role will be
  played once and only once, no matter in what order you specify it.

* Quick Start

** Mac OS X 10.10

To start, you need to install the following things.

*** XCode

Please download and install Xcode from the Mac App Store and the necessary
Command Line Tools, refer this [[http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html][post]] for simple tutorial.

*** Homebrew

There're various package managers for Mac, among which [[http://brew.sh/][homebrew]] is the best and
most popular. It's quite easy to install:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
#+END_SRC

Then you also get [[http://caskroom.io/][homebrew cask]] via:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
#+END_SRC

Homebrew cask is really great if you want to install some huge binary packages
such as Emacs, [[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/][pycharm]], etc.


** Ansible

The only thing oh-my-laptop depends is ansible, please do [[http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html][install]] it before you
join the journey.

** Will you trust me?

I've write a bootstrap script to get homebrew(on Mac) and ansible for you:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-laptop/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
#+END_SRC

* What's inside?

One line code to get all packages configured by oh-my-laptop:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -name README.org | xargs grep "|" | grep -v Package | grep -v '\-\-\-\-' | sed 's/^.*org://g'
#+END_SRC
